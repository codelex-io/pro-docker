# Exercise

Create an image that requires a single argument - an ID of the public Github repository, for example `codelex-io/pro-docker`.

When container is run it prints out the contents of the `README.md` file and exits.

### Bonus point

Create an image that asks for Github repository ID in the build time, stores the contents. And when run prints out the contents of the `README.md` file.
