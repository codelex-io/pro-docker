Adding a web server to docker-compose

### Description

Create a docker-compose.yml and add a web server of your choice to it.

Change the outside port to 49161.

### Requirements for Completion

- server config should be available in Docker-compose.yml
- Server should be started with docker compose up command instead of docker run command

### Explanation

When working, it is easier to just executing a "docker compose up" command with no parameters as they are defined in docker-compose.yml, 
than executing a "docker run" command with a lot of parameters.
